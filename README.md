**Overview**

This project focuses on the application of time series predictive modeling techniques to analyze and forecast inpatient (IP) data. We use models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing to provide robust and accurate predictions that can significantly enhance decision-making processes within healthcare institutions.

*Note*: This project is in the testing phase. We are currently evaluating different models to identify the best fit. Stay tuned for a more advanced and upgraded version!

**Highlights**
*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*

Trend Analysis
Seasonality Detection
Outlier Identification
Correlation Analysis
Model Implementation

*ARIMA*: Captures linear dependencies in non-stationary data.
*SARIMA*: Adds seasonal elements to ARIMA for periodic trends.
*Exponential Smoothing*: Smooths data for short-term forecasts.

**Benefits**
1. Healthcare Management: Optimize staffing, bed allocation, and inventory.
2. Policy Making: Assist in healthcare planning and budget allocation.
3. Financial Planning: Improve financial preparedness and cost management.
4. Emergency Preparedness: Anticipate surges and allocate resources effectively.
   
**Future Scope**
. Integration with Real-Time Data: For dynamic, up-to-date forecasting.
. Incorporation of External Variables: Enhance accuracy with economic, policy, and environmental data.
. Advanced Modeling Techniques: Explore LSTM networks and Prophet.
. Scalability: Adapt the solution for global healthcare institutions.
. Automation and Deployment: Create a user-friendly tool for healthcare professionals.

**Stay tuned for the upcoming advanced version of this project! We're working on incorporating cutting-edge technologies to make time series forecasting even more powerful and accessible.**
